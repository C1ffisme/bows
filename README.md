This is a small bows mod I made for Minetest in an
attempt to get Minecraft-like drawback.

It uses a hack based on `minetest.after()` and changing
the item that the player is wielding. It's not pretty,
but it's the best I can manage because Minetest doesn't
actually have an API for holding down keys or changing
an item's texture based on certain conditions.
